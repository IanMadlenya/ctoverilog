This is a fork of the code from www.c-to-verilog.com

The original code was written by Nadav Rotem.

Since the original code was not released under any form of source code control, and has not advanced for some time, I moved it to a public GIT repository in order to advance it further.
Near term goals are to update the code to the latest LLVM relase (currently the code requires LLVM 2.5).

This code is licensed under the GPL v3 license, according to the terms in www.c-to-verilog.com
